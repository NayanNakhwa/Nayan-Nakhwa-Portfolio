# UX/UI Design Brief: "Engineered Precision"

## 1. Core Concept
The design should reflect your background: **Electronics, QA, and IoT.**
It shouldn't look like a standard marketing site. It should look like a *dashboard* or a *blueprint*.

## 2. Color Palette (Dark Mode Default)
*   **Background:** `#0f172a` (Slate 900) - Deep, technical dark blue/grey.
*   **Surface:** `#1e293b` (Slate 800) - Lighter cards for content.
*   **Primary Accent:** `#38bdf8` (Sky 400) - Represents "Telecom/Signal/Electricity".
*   **Secondary Accent:** `#10b981` (Emerald 500) - Represents "Success/QA Pass".
*   **Text:** `#f1f5f9` (Slate 100) - High contrast for readability.

## 3. Typography
*   **Headings:** `Inter` (Bold/ExtraBold). Clean and authoritative.
*   **Body:** `Inter` (Regular).
*   **Accents (Dates, Tags, Code):** `JetBrains Mono` or `Fira Code`. This adds the "Developer" flavor.

## 4. Interactive Elements ("The Awwwards Touch")

### The "Spotlight" Effect
We will implement a mouse-tracking spotlight effect on cards. As the mouse moves over the Skills grid, a subtle radial gradient follows the cursor, illuminating the borders of the grid items. This looks very high-end.

### Scramble Text Effect
On the Hero section, when the page loads, your name or title could "decode" itself (random characters cycling into the final letters).
*   *Example:* `N....` -> `Na...` -> `Nayan`.
*   *Why:* Fits the "Encryption/Security/Data" theme of your thesis project.

### The "Connector" Lines
Draw subtle SVG lines connecting sections, mimicking a circuit board or a network topology map, referencing your background in Network Security & IoT.

## 5. Navigation
*   **Sticky Header:** Glassmorphism effect (blur background).
*   **Progress Bar:** A thin line at the top of the screen showing how far down the resume the user has scrolled.
